# **App Name**: SommelierPro AI

## Core Features:

- Wine AI Description: Upon receiving the wine's name (brand, variety), the tool generates a detailed description of its visual, olfactory, gustative characteristics, as well as the wine's structure.
- Variety AI Description: Provides the general descriptors of a wine variety upon receiving the variety's name only. If the app doesn't find the specific wine requested, the tool generates a description based on similar wines, noting that the analysis is app-generated.
- Wine Details Enrichment AI: LLM reasons about the wine details by outputting crianza times, barrique types, maridajes recomendados (ideal plates, consumption moments, right combinations), maridajes to avoid (combinations that ruin the experience), type of wine (young, reserve, aging, sparkling, natural, etc), quality/commercial level (massive, standard, premium, icon), cultural or regional notes relevant, suggested target audience (novice palate, intermediate, expert).
- Descriptor Images: Generates illustrative images based on the visual, olfactory, gustatory, and structural descriptors of the wine, as a tool for a comprehensive sensory understanding. For all descriptors and suggested plates, visual representation can be displayed through generative AI.
- Cata Sheet: The app generates a 'Cata' (tasting) sheet that includes the generated description and illustrative images, which can be downloaded or shared as a photo or video, similar to Leonardo.ai.
- Description Template: The generated description will capture these aspects: visual description (color, intensity, limpidity, tear, evolution); olfactory analysis (primary, secondary, tertiary aromas, intensity, complexity); gustatory phase (attack, acidity, body, tannins, balance, aftertaste); final sensations (persistence, harmony, elegance, rusticity); language should be evocative, professional, and educational, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon and focusing on clear metaphors and analogies.
- Food Description Wine Recommendation: Recommends a wine based on a description of what the user is eating. The LLM will reason about which descriptors in the description are most relevant to wine pairing.
- Four-Course Wine Pairing: Suggests a wine for each course of a four-course meal and explains the pairing. The LLM will reason about the courses provided to recommend and explain the wine pairings.
